# An Independent Guide to the Hong Kong Protests

I originally intended to call this article "A Neutral Guide to the Hong Kong Protests", but realized that would be a lie. I have a bias, and that bias will, naturally, affect the content of this piece, its sources, and its presentation.
However, I do wish to mention that while neutrality is a word I cannot get myself to use, my intent is to provide a full, fair and comprehensive review of the events. The ultimate goal is to provide an independent source of information which people can use to inform themselves about the protests, without having to worry about the affiliations of the writer.

## Quick facts about Hong Kong you should know before we proceed:

* Population: ~7,500,000
* Over 90% of the population is ethnically Han Chinese 
* The official languages are Chinese and English, with Cantonese (not Mandarin!) being the dialect spoken by the locals
* (Only around 3% of Hong Kong youths identify themselves as "Chinese")[https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-hongkong-anniversary-idUSKBN19B1IE]

## History
While Hong Kong's history goes back thousands of years, it should be sufficient to start from the British Colonial era. I'll attempt to keep this section as short as possible.

### British Rule

In 1841, during the First Opium War, the British occupied Hong Kong, which was then officially ceded to Great Britain by the Chinese in 1842, through the Treaty of Nanking. The terms of the treaty stated that Hong Kong was "to be possessed in perpetuity" by Britain [1]. "Hong Kong" at that time referred only to what is today called "Hong Kong Island".

The treaty marked the beginning of the era of Colonial Hong Kong, which would last until the late 20th century. During this time, the British made significant efforts to implement Western education and religious practices on the island and built up the judicial system in Hong Kong based on their own system. British influence is also noticeable in day-to-day life, as Hong Kongers drive on the left (wrong) side, like many other former British colonies.

During the Second Opium War, the British then took over Kowloon, and, in 1898, worried about protecting Hong Kong Island, the British agreed upon a 99-year lease with the Chinese for the New Territories and multiple surrounding islands. This created a buffer zone for military attacks and established the territory that is today collectively referred to as Hong Kong.

As of today, Hong Kong, the Special Administrative Region, refers to the collection of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories, and the Outlying Islands.Until Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997, Hong Kong remained under British rule, except for a brief period under Japanese occupation during WW2. During this time, it developed rapidly and became one of the world's most important financial hubs, as well as one of the busiest ports.

### The Handover

In the 1980s, Britain and the People's Republic of China (PRC), at the time represented by Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping, began talks about the future of Hong Kong, as the lease for the New Territories was set to expire in 1997. 
1842's Treaty of Nanking was considered by the Chinese as an "unequal treaty", and the PRC expressed its opinion that Hong Kong should be returned to China in its entirety, meaning the leased land as well as Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. 

While the lease on the New Territories was set to expire, Britain could have still kept the rest of the land. However, having colonies was out of fashion, and keeping only Kowloon and the Island would mean that the city would be significantly exposed to military attacks and other conflicts with the Chinese. The threat from a Chinese invasion had always been a possibility, and according to declassified colonial records from the British, was what kept them from instituting democracy in Hong Kong.

The documents, analyzed here, claim that Mao Zedong threatened to invade Hong Kong in the 1950s if the British were to grant it self-governance. A democracy close to China would pose a threat to their authoritarian regime, but a friendly colony gave it easy access to international trade, which it would not have otherwise.

The option of granting independence to Hong Kong was also not a possibility, due to Chinese lobbying in the UN in the previous decade leading to resolutions preventing self-determination in Hong Kong and Macau (read more here).

As such, it was ultimately agreed that the entirety of Hong Kong would be handed over to China in 1997, under the "One Country Two Systems" policy, which allowed it to retain some of its "independence" for 50 years, after which it would become part of the socialist system in full.

The decision was resented by many Hong Kongers, especially after the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, prompting widespread emigration, especially to the UK (who granted Hong Kongers with right of abode and a special passport), Australia and Canada (notably to Vancouver). 

As a representation of Anti-China sentiment, Hong Kongers also hold vigils every year on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, with attendance reaching over one hundred thousand in recent years. 

Furthermore, multiple universities in the city have statues to remember the protests in 1989, such as CUHK's "Goddess of Democracy" and Hong Kong University's famous "Pillar of Shame", added to the campus just before the Handover and gaining "permanent residence" in 1998.

### One Country Two Systems

The One Country Two Systems policy was designed by Deng Xiaoping as part of the discussions for Hong Kong's handover in the 1980s. The policy determines that Hong Kong and China are still united under one country (China), but follow different political and economic systems. 

In practice, it means that Hong Kong can retain its own legal and legislative systems, its own currency and individual freedoms until 2047, when it should formally be reintegrated into China and abide by the Chinese socialist system. This means Hong Kong is free to trade with other countries as it wishes, and also that citizens have their own passports and must go through customs to access Mainland China.

The terms of this system were agreed upon in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, which laid out the terms for Hong Kong's period as a Special Administrative Region (SAR), from 1997 to 2047.

### Occupy Central
Protesters camping in Central Hong Kong, 2014. Background

The Joint Declaration of 1984 determined that Hong Kong Basic Law serve as the territory's version of a constitution for its 50 years under the "One Country Two Systems" policy.

One controversial statement, however, exists in Article 45 of the Basic Law (read in full here), and reads:
"The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures."

This line in the Basic Law is interpreted by many Hong Kongers to mean that universal suffrage must be enacted in Hong Kong during the 50-year period. However, lines preceding this sentence leave room for ambiguity as to how the election process should actually be conducted.

The Article states, for example, that Hong Kong's CEO (yes, CEO), can be selected either through election or through "consultations held locally" and must be appointed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). As such, and perhaps intentionally, there is little clarity as to how the process should be conducted for electing the Chief Executive, as well as the Legislative Council (LegCo) in Hong Kong.

In discussing a reform of the election process in 2014, the government then established a set of provisions for future elections, which led to widespread outrage. The decision was published on the 31st of August (a widely remembered date) and caused the spark which led to the Occupy Central movement, known internationally as the Umbrella Movement.

The decision (read here) stated, for example, that the Chief Executive "shall be a person who loves the country [China] and loves Hong Kong", which was seen by some as a potential way to prevent pro-democracy candidates from running, on claims of lack of love for China.

Effectively, the decision in 2014 did not live up to the expectations of many, who saw it as a denial of universal suffrage to the people of Hong Kong, as mentioned in Articles 45 (for the CEO elections) and 68 (for the LegCo elections).

*Author's Note*

For reference, the Hong Kong political system currently works as follows:
The CEO is selected from a pool of candidates approved by the Chinese government and voted on by a 1200-person Election Committee.
The Legislative Council (somewhat analogous to a Parliament), has 70 seats, of which 40 are selected via general election and 30 are voted on by corporations which represent the main industries of Hong Kong (Finance, Insurance, Medical, etc.)
Pro-democracy candidates usually win the popular vote by a significant margin, but business representation (the other 30 available seats) is overwhelmingly Pro-Beijing (see more), resulting in majority support for Beijing in the LegCo, which has never been challenged.

**The Movement**

As a result of the August 31 decision, peaceful rallies took place in September, culminating in the launch of the "Occupy Central with Peace and Love" movement - shortened to "Occupy Central", where demonstrators occupied central areas of Hong Kong for over two months to initially protest against the decision regarding the upcoming elections, and later against what was perceived as excessive use of force by the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) to disperse demonstrators.

The number of demonstrators on the streets was often in the tens of thousands, some times exceeding "well over" a hundred thousand, as reported by Reuters. News and messages about the demonstrations were banned in China (see: WeChat allegedly censoring photos of HK protests).

The goal of the movement was to incite discussion about universal suffrage and included a Civic Referendum regarding different proposed solutions for moving towards more open elections in the territory, which drew over 700,000 responses.

As early as 28 September, two days after the occupation began in the city, police used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse peaceful protesters (see here), which led to outrage and greater numbers of demonstrators in subsequent protests condemning police actions.

As a result, protesters began to use umbrellas to protect themselves from pepper spray in clashes with the police, earning the movement the name of Umbrella Movement or Umbrella Revolution. Umbrellas are still a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong until this day.

During the 79-day occupation, demonstrations were also held by those against the movement, citing the disruption of daily life as a reason for their opposition. However, news organizations (such as SCMP) also confirmed that some people were paid to participate in anti-occupy protests by local triads (crime organizations), aiming to create riots providing an excuse for police to arrest demonstrators.

Ultimately, after multiple clashes with the police, the demonstrations ended in mid-December, after hundreds of arrests and the voluntary action by some protest leaders to turn themselves to the police and face charges for civil disobedience.

Protests in support of pro-democracy leaders of the movement were later held in 2017, following their conviction for the role played in the 2014 protests. 

## 2019 Pro-Democracy Movement

### The Extradition Bill

In February 2019, a paper is submitted to the LegCo suggesting amendments which would allow for extradition to Mainland China on a case-by-case basis. The first protest against these amendments then took place in late March when thousands marched against the proposal.

During April and May, the government then drafts a bill to include the proposed amendments, partially fueled by the case of a Taiwanese man accused of murdering his wife and fleeing to Hong Kong for protection. CEO Carrie Lam claims to be determined to pass the bill, which would allow extradition to China in addition to the 20 countries Hong Kong has extradition treaties with.

Pro-democracy lawmakers opposed the bill and in early June, following a small protest a few days earlier, over half a million protesters marched on the streets on the 9th of June to show their opposition to the bill. Protesters claimed the bill could allow for arbitrary extradition to China for those who speak badly of the CCP, limiting their freedom of expression. Their fears were partly justified by the case of the bookstore owners who disappeared a few years earlier and were later found to be arrested in China, for selling books that exposed truths about high officials of the Communist Party. Demonstrators felt that the bill would allow cases like this to become more frequent.

A month later, in July, Carrie Lam announced the bill was "dead" but the government had not yet formally withdrawn it, thus failing to appease protesters. From then on, the movement took a larger scope to encompass pro-democracy values beyond just the extradition bill.

### 5 Demands

Albeit sparked by the extradition bill, the Hong Kong protests were always a reflection of a broader Anti-China and pro-democracy sentiment by Hong Kongers, who feel that China has begun meddling in Hong Kong affairs too early, while certain freedoms should still be maintained until 2047 (here's a 2018 video talking about this).

As such, as the government failed to take firm action against the bill early on, the movement grew in size and became what is now the longest chain of pro-democracy protests the city has ever seen. The bill was withdrawn in early September but much before then, protesters had already devised the 5 demands that they are currently calling for, explaining why withdrawing the bill was "not enough".

These 5 demands (as shown here) are:

1. Full withdrawal of the extradition bill 
2. An independent commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
3. Retracting the classification of protesters as "rioters" 
4. Amnesty for arrested protesters 
5. (Dual) Universal Suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive 

Out of these demands, Number 1 has already been fulfilled, but the withdrawal of the bill is widely accepted as having happened too late and led to the famous slogan now used by protesters: "Five Demands, Not One Less". The slogan is a reference to how fulfilling one or even four of the demands is not enough, but rather they must all be fulfilled for the movement to stop.

### Terminology and Symbolism

Before we continue and go over some of the key events of the movement, here are some terms and symbols you might want to know about: 

* **Yellow vs Blue:** Terms used to denominate the two camps from the 2014 protests carried over to 2019. Yellow referred to those who were pro-occupy, while blue referred to those who were against the occupation. In 2019 Yellow refers to Pro-democracy/Pro-Protesters and Blue refers to Pro-Beijing/Pro-Establishment/Pro-Police.
* **Black vs White:** Since protesters made black their official color, Pro-Beijing supporters opt for white shirts when protesting against the movement.
* **Rioters:** A sensitive term used by police and Pro-Beijing supporters to describe the protesters. The term is condemned by the protesters and the crux of one of the five demands. Rioter is a problematic term because, in Hong Kong, someone convicted of rioting can spend up to 10 years in jail. 
* **Freedom Fighters:** A term used by some Pro-Democracy activists to describe the Hong Kong protesters, especially frontliners.
* **Frontliners:** Protesters who make up the front line in clashes against the police. They are often students or young people who are the most engaged and extreme of the protesters, resisting the police with bricks, Molotov cocktails, setting up barricades, etc. Non-frontline protesters often help deliver supplies to the frontlines via human chains.
* **Cockroaches:** A derogatory term used by some to describe Pro-Democracy protesters.
* **Terrorists:** A derogatory term used by some to describe the Hong Kong police officers.
* **Raptors:** "Special Tactical Squad" of the Hong Kong police. Raptors can be identified by their dark blue uniforms, contrasted with traditional riot police's green uniforms. They are deployed to the most intense clashes and are often seen running full speed to arrest protesters in "surprise attacks".
* **Umbrellas:** Symbol of the 2014 movement. In 2019 they have also been used by protesters to cover their faces from cameras and protect themselves from police water cannons.
* **Eye patch:** During demonstrations in August, a woman was hit in the eye with what was widely believed to be a police-fired beanbag round, sparking outrage and leading to protesters using eye patches and the slogan "An Eye for An Eye". This was later intensified when an Indonesian journalist covering the protests was shot by a rubber bullet in the right eye, which police confirmed made her blind on that eye.
* **Anti-China symbols:** Protesters often use Winnie the Pooh imagery (here's the reason for this) and the term "Chinazi" to express their Anti-China views. Chinese flags have also been burned during the protests.

## Key Events

### Timeline of the Bill
Partially discussed above, the bill was "born" as a suggestion in February, discussed and refined during April/May, "indefinitely delayed" on June 15, declared "dead" by Lam on July 9 and formally withdrawn on September 4.

### First Protests
The first "official" protest happened on June 6 and gathered a few thousand people. Three days later, on June 9, over half a million marched against the bill.

### First Rioting Charges
Dozens of demonstrators charged with rioting, the first time during the 2019 protests. As mentioned before, rioting convictions carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, as opposed to the lighter sentences for "unlawful assembly".

### Triad Attack 

On the 21st of June, following a protest in Central Hong Kong, men dressed in white shirts ambushed and attacked protesters and passers-by with poles at a train station. Police took a long time to arrive at the scene and originally made no arrests. A whistleblower told Korean journalists the police force allegedly did not respond to the calls in due time to let protesters feel the need for the police.

Police later claimed to have made 6 arrests in association with the events. The group who attacked protesters includes members known to be associated with triads (Hong Kong's gangs).

### Kwai Fong Station Incident
On August 11, police fired tear gas inside Kwai Fong station in an attempt to contain protesters. Many were outraged and pointed out tear gas should not be fired inside.

### Occupation of the Airport

In Early August, protesters first occupied the International Airport in Hong Kong. For a few days, flights were severely disrupted and airport protests continued to happen somewhat regularly throughout September until police implemented strong measures to prevent any further occurrences. 

Those making their way to the airport via Hong Kong's Airport Express train had bags searched and boarding passes checked, and similar checkpoints were also set up at the airport, preventing anyone who was not going to fly from entering the airport.

The airport occupation got widespread international attention as travel plans of foreigners were disrupted by the demonstrations. Videos also surfaced online of foreign travelers discussing with protesters and complaining about the occupation.

### Prince Edward Station Incident 

Following a protest on August 31, when groups of protesters vandalized subway stations, a scuffle broke out between demonstrators and passengers at Prince Edward station, leading to a disruption in the service and the eventual evacuation of the station.

Subsequently, riot police entered the station to mitigate the issue but handled the situation poorly, beating protesters and regular passengers alike. The police claimed it was difficult to identify protesters and ultimately around 60 people were arrested because of the incident, charged with unlawful assembly and possession of lethal weapons.

The police were heavily criticized for the incident because of their arbitrary beatings as well as for preventing paramedics and firefighters to enter the scene, despite multiple people at the station being visibly injured. 

### CCP's 70th Anniversary

The protests on China's National Day (October 1st) were highly anticipated and one of the most violent days of demonstrations in Hong Kong until then. China's Communist Party was celebrating 70 years and China held its largest military parade to date to commemorate, while protesters hoped to overshadow the celebrations, protesting heavily during the weekend leading up to the date, as well as on the National Day itself.

During the October 1st protests, the first protester was shot by a live round, with the bullet hitting 3cm from his heart. The protester was in critical condition but did not die, and images of his x-ray were highly publicized by demonstrators.

Demonstrators then vandalized Chinese-linked businesses and subway stations the following day in protest to the shooting. Subway stations have been a prime target for vandalism due to the MTR Corporation's Pro-China stance and collaboration with the HKPF during the demonstrations.

### Ban on Face Masks

Hong Kong's embattled chief executive, Carrie Lam, says she is invoking emergency powers to ban face masks during…www.npr.org
On October 4, Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam made use of emergency colonial-era powers to institute a ban on face masks at public assemblies. The move was strongly disputed by protesters, who defied the ban since it was announced, and members of the international community. It has since been ruled unconstitutional by the Hong Kong High Court.

### Weekend Protests for Chow Tsz-lok's death

Following the death of 22-year-old student Chow Tsz-lok, blamed largely on the police by protesters, demonstrators escalated violence during a weekend of widespread protests across Hong Kong. 
During the weekend, a student was shot by a live round fired by a police officer and a Pro-Beijing civilian was lit on fire by a protester, increasing antagonism between the two sides.
